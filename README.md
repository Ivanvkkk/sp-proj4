# Practical 4 (group-work): Newton optimizer
Programming Task: in your work group of 3, to write an R function, newt, implementing Newtonâ€™s method for
minimization of functions. Only functions in base R and its packages (including recommended packages) can
be used and your code must not install any packages. Do not use functions attach or solve. Your submitted
code should only define functions, and not have any code outside functions except for loading permitted package
(it can of course contain functions other than newt).
